<p>Troubleshooting Tips</p>

<p>Q: The homepage shows the server is stopped or if Nicecast can&#8217;t connect.</p>

<p>A: Start the streaming server:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to caster.fm

<ul>
<li>username: osustudentradio</li>
<li>password: arouseftw</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click &#8220;Start Server&#8221; at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Go to Nicecast and check that it has connected, or click the &#8220;Start Broadcast&#8221; button.</li>
<li>Talk or play music.</li>
</ol>

<p>Q: iPod/computer/microphone sound isn&#8217;t playing (meaning the lights on the sound board aren&#8217;t moving).</p>

<p>A: Double check these:</p>

<ul>
<li>The channel is unmuted (the light should be off)</li>
<li>The volume slider is turned up (it should be around the &#8216;0&#8217; marker)</li>
<li>The volume is turned up on the iPod/Spotify</li>
<li>The music is actually playing (press play a couple times just to be sure)</li>
<li>The cable is plugged in properly in the board and the device (unplug it and plug it back in if necessary)</li>
<li>Computer specific steps:
<ol>
<li>Press command + space.</li>
<li>Type "System Preferences"</li>
<li>Click "Sound"</li>
<li>In the "Output" tab, select "Headphones" and check that the volume slider at the bottom is at about 80%.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Q: Listeners are saying the music keeps cutting out.</p>

<p>A: Nothing we can do, unfortunately. Our internet connection is kind of slow. The only suggestion is to avoid browsing the internet using Rendezvous&#8217; connection.</p>
