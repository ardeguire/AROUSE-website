<p>Troubleshooting Tips</p>

<p>Q: Edcast can&#8217;t connect.</p>

<p>A: Check the streaming server:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Edcast and check that it has connected, or click the &#8220;Connect&#8221; button.</li>
<li>If there is no item in the lower box that says either "Disconnected" or a bit rate, click the "Add Encoder" button.</li>
<li>If that doesn't work, check that there is not another copy of Edcast running. Check the tray in the lower right of the screen, someone may have minimized it. Close all the copies that are disconnected, they're not doing anything helpful.</li>
<!-- go to the menu item Window > Show Server and check that the settings match:<br /><ul><li>Server Type: Icecast 2</li><li>Account: blank</li><li>Password: arouseFTW!</li><li>Address: 198.211.115.41</li><li>Port: 8000</li><li>Mount Point: /stream</li><li>Public URL: http://arouseosu.com</li></ul> <br /><img src="nicecast_server_settings.png" /></li> -->
<li>Call Adam to start the streaming server (he's working on a button for you to click, but he has other priorities).</li>
<li>Talk or play music.</li>
</ol>

<p>Q: iPod/computer/microphone sound isn&#8217;t playing (meaning the lights on the sound board aren&#8217;t moving).</p>

<p>A: Double check these:</p>

<ul>
<li>The channel is unmuted (the light should be off)</li>
<li>The volume slider is turned up (it should be around the &#8216;0&#8217; marker)</li>
<li>The volume is turned up on the iPod/Spotify</li>
<li>The music is actually playing (press play a couple times just to be sure)</li>
<li>The cable is plugged in properly in the board and the device (unplug it and plug it back in if necessary)</li>
<!--
<li>Computer specific steps:
<ol>
<li>Press command + space.</li>
<li>Type "System Preferences"</li>
<li>Click "Sound"</li>
<li>In the "Output" tab, select "Headphones" and check that the volume slider at the bottom is at about 80%.</li>
</ol></li>
-->
</ul>

<p>Q: Listeners are saying the music keeps cutting out.</p>

<p>A: Nothing we can do, unfortunately. Our internet connection is kind of slow. The only suggestion is to avoid browsing the internet using Rendezvous&#8217; connection.</p>
