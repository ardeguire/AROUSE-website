## Website design and code by Adam De Guire

### Features:

1. The page header, sidebar, and footer are pulled from separate files, making it easier to make changes that propogate across the site.
2. Each element of the nav bar can be accessd by the url `http://www.arouseosu.com/item`. For example, to acces the schedule, use `http://www.arouseosu.com/schedule` and it will redirect you to the `schedule.php` page.
